## 0.9.0

Initial release of Alloy. This library is intended to eventually replace the Tenant Security Client libraries, and include additional functionality. Right now this includes:

- our standard (probabilistic, fully random) encryption
- deterministic encryption 
- Cloaked AI vector encryption

All three of these support standalone and SaaS Shield modes in this SDK.

Notable features coming soon:
- SaaS Shield security events
- backwards compatibility with TSC libraries
- batch APIs
- rekey and rotate functionality

### Compatibility

Requires TSP 4.12.0+.
