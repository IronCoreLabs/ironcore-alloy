# IronCore Labs Alloy SDK

Ironcore Alloy SDK is designed to be a single SDK for all the different IronCore products. This includes AES, deterministic, and vector encryption. It also has support for multiple types of key management including integration with [Saas Shield](https://ironcorelabs.com/products/saas-shield/). The goal is for this SDK to be all you need to easily encrypt all your data for your application regardless of your key management strategy.
